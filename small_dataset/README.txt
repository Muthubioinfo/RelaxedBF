######## Smaller datasets for Bayesian clock model selection #################

This directory contains 13 alignment files.  The Mito_primate_1-3.zip contains the '.phy', '.trees' and '.ctl'. files used to test Bayesian model selection for the dataset consisting of three partitioned alignments of seven ape mitochondrial genomes. The mammal_dataset_4-13.zip contains the ten protein-coding (first and second codon positions) gene alignments consisting of 72 mammalian genomes (√Ålvarez-Carretero et al. 2022). The respective gene names from reference human genome are provided below, for the respective ensemble IDs.


File (.phy)	Name					Codon position
align1.phy 	Mitochondrial genome of seven apes 	1
align2.phy 	Mitochondrial genome of seven apes 	2
align3.phy 	Mitochondrial genome of seven apes 	3
