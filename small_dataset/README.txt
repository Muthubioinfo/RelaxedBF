###############Real data analysis############


We analysed three different datasets for Bayesian clock model selection

This directory contains 13 alignment files. Files from align1.phy to align10.phy (see mamma_dataset_1-10.zip) are the ten protein-coding (first and second codon positions) gene alignments consisting of 72 mammalian genomes (√Ålvarez-Carretero et al. 2022). The respective gene names from reference human genome are provided below, for the respective ensemble IDs. align11.phy, align12.phy and align13.phy (see Mito_primate_11-13.zip) are the three codon partitions of seven ape mitochondrial genomes.
