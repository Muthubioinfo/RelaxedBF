# Bayesian clock model selection
Files used for Bayesian clock/relaxed clock model selection 


Simulate_trees.R  - To simulate phylogenetic trees under strict clock, independent-rates and geometric brownian motion


Real datasets - Three datasets were tested for Bayesian model selection 

(1) Small dataset: Mammalian protein-coding genes (Alvarez et al. 2022) and primate mitochondrial proteins (Yang and Rannala, 2006)
(2) Primate dataset: primate tree of 372 species obtained from dos Reis et al. (2018). This dataset consists of six alignment partitions
(3) Plant dataset: Phylogeny of 644 flowering plants obtained from Barba‚ÄêMontoya et al. 2018. This has three alignment partitions.
