Files for Bayesian clock/relaxed clock model selection paper

(1) The "simulate_trees.R" can be used to construct simulation under different rate models - Strict clock, Independent-log normal and geometric brownian motion.

The simulation_files contains the input files such as the '.ctl' files for MCMCTree analysis and '.tree' for each fossil calibration setting (slightly misspecified, badly misspecified, and no calibration). In "simulation_files/simulation_results", the tables with the results can be found for each calibration setting. The "Table 

(2) Real dataset: The small_dataset, primate_dataset and plant_dataset.zip contains the input files used for marginal likelihood estimation
